  DAILY SCHEDULER - USER MANUAL
  Local Configuration
================================================================================


WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
Daily Scheduler is a personal productivity app that structures your workday
into focused time blocks. It keeps a countdown timer running in the background,
shows your tasks for each block of the day, and tracks what you finished versus
what got left over.

Here's the deal: your day is pre-divided into chunks of time. You fill each
chunk with tasks before the day starts, hit Start, and the timer walks you
through your day automatically -- work block, break, work block, break -- all
the way to the end of the day.

You don't have to think about time management while you're trying to do things.
The app does that part. Your one job is to work the list.

  ( If you're thinking "I've tried systems like this before and I always --"
    yeah. We know. Keep reading. This one's a little different. )


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS STRUCTURE? (READ THIS PART)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most productivity apps are built for people who just need a nudge. You don't
need a nudge. You need a system that doesn't punish you for being human.

This app is intentionally rigid. There are no customizable block lengths, no
adjustable break times, no "power modes." That's not an oversight -- that's
the whole point.

Here's what happens when you add flexibility: you feel badass at 7am and set
90-minute blocks with 5-minute breaks. By 10am you've missed two breaks and
now the timer is your enemy. You tweak it. Then you tweak it again. Then you
close the app and feel bad about yourself. This app doesn't let you do that.

The blocks are 45 minutes. The breaks are 15 minutes. They're generous on
purpose -- generous enough that missing the beginning of a break isn't a
catastrophe. Generous enough that you can actually finish what's in a block.
The goal is to get *something* meaningful done today. Not everything. Something.

  "The perfect schedule is the enemy of the done schedule."
    -- someone with ADHD, probably, trying to justify watching YouTube

The timer is also designed for people who aren't glued to their desk. You
might be in the garage, the kitchen, the yard. The local chime will still
reach you. The day keeps moving whether you're watching it or not.

One more thing: tasks you didn't finish don't disappear. They go to the queue.
If something sits in the queue for a week, that's information -- maybe it's not
actually a priority, or maybe it needs to be broken into smaller pieces. The
app doesn't judge you. It just keeps count.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE DAILY SCHEDULE (BUILT IN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app runs a fixed schedule every day. You don't configure this -- it's
baked in. Each day looks like this:

  Planning         20 minutes   (assign tasks, drink coffee, be a person)
  Break            15 minutes   (decompress, ease in -- you're not late)
  Block 1          45 minutes   work
  Break            15 minutes
  Block 2          45 minutes   work
  Break            15 minutes
  Block 3          45 minutes   work
  Break            15 minutes
  Block 4          45 minutes   work
  Break            15 minutes
  Block 5          45 minutes   work
  LUNCH            30 minutes   (actual food, not "I'll eat later")
  Block 6          45 minutes   work
  Break            15 minutes
  Block 7          45 minutes   work
  Break            15 minutes
  Block 8          45 minutes   work
  --- Day Complete ---

Total: 8 work blocks (6 hours of focused work) + breaks + planning.
The timer advances automatically -- you don't need to do anything between phases.


A NOTE ABOUT THE FIRST 35 MINUTES
----------------------------------
That's not wasted time. That's your ramp-up.

The 20-minute Planning phase is not just for filling in task boxes. It's for
arriving at your day. Get coffee. Take a piss. Clear the dish graveyard off
your desk. Stare at the ceiling for a minute. Think about what actually needs
to happen today.

The 15-minute break that follows isn't filler -- it's a hard stop to the
chaos. A "now we begin" moment. By the time Block 1 starts, you've had 35
minutes to become functional. That's not a bug.

If you open the app, hit Start, and immediately feel like you're behind --
you're not. This is the design. The day starts when you're ready.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SCREEN LAYOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The window is divided into sections from top to bottom:

  [ TIMER BAR ]            -- always visible at the top
  [ PLANNING BLOCK ]       -- one wide row below the timer
  [ BLOCK 1 ] [ BLOCK 2 ] -- 8 task blocks arranged in a grid
  [ BLOCK 3 ] [ BLOCK 4 ]    (2 columns by default, resizes with window)
  [ BLOCK 5 ] [ BLOCK 6 ]
  [ BLOCK 7 ] [ BLOCK 8 ]
  [ TASK QUEUE ]           -- dark red bar at the very bottom
  [ Start New Day ] [ Save ] [ Exit ]   -- buttons along the bottom edge


TIMER BAR (top strip)
---------------------
Color tells you what's happening at a glance -- no reading required:

  Green  = work block running        (you should be doing a thing)
  Blue   = break running             (you should not be doing a thing)
  Orange = paused                    (timer is waiting for you)
  Dark   = stopped / end of day

The bar shows:
  - Current phase name (e.g., "Planning", "Block 3", "Break")
  - Large countdown (MM:SS format)
  - A progress bar showing how far through the current phase you are

Controls on the timer bar:

  ▶ Start    Start the timer (or resume after a pause)
  ⏸ Pause    Pause the countdown -- pick up where you left off later
  ⭭ Skip     Jump immediately to the next phase (skips remaining time)
  ↺ Reset    Reset everything back to Planning / 20:00 (does NOT clear tasks)
  ■ End Day  Stop the timer completely for the day -- no more announcements

Also on the timer bar (top-left corner):

  Announcement mode radio buttons:
    Voice Monkey  = announcements go to your Alexa via Voice Monkey (requires setup)
    Local Chime   = plays a chime sound on this computer instead

  Dataset radio buttons:
    Home  = uses the "home" task list and data folder
    Work  = uses a separate "work" task list (always local-only)

  Switching datasets is instant -- your tasks for each context are saved
  separately so home tasks and work tasks never mix.


PLANNING BLOCK
--------------
The wide section below the timer bar. Use this during the 20-minute Planning
phase at the start of your day.

Add tasks here that you haven't assigned to a specific block yet, or use it
as a staging area. Tasks in Planning can be moved to any numbered block using
the arrow buttons that appear on each task row.

Think of this as your "dump everything here first, sort it out in a minute"
zone. You don't have to be organized to start. You just have to start.


BLOCKS 1-8
----------
Each block represents one 45-minute work session. Add the tasks you plan to
work on during that session.

Inside each block:
  - A list of tasks, each with:
      [ ] checkbox to mark it done
      Text field for the task description
      [→] move button to send the task to a different block or to Planning
      [x] delete button to remove the task
  - "+ Add Task" button at the bottom

Press Enter inside a task field to jump to the next task, or create a new
one if you're on the last task in the block.

The ACTIVE block (the one the timer is currently in) gets a highlighted border
so you always know which block you should be working on right now.

  TIP: 2-4 tasks per block is realistic. More than that and you're writing
  a wishlist, not a schedule. The 45-minute block will not grow to accommodate
  your optimism.


TASK QUEUE (bottom section, dark red)
--------------------------------------
When you hit "Start New Day" at the end of the day, any tasks that were NOT
checked as completed automatically move here instead of disappearing.

The queue is your "didn't finish" pile. No shame. It happens. Tasks persist
across days so nothing gets lost.

From the queue you can:
  - Move a task into any numbered Block for today
  - Move a task back to the Planning block
  - Each task shows how many times it's been queued, so you can see if
    something keeps getting pushed off day after day

  If something has been queued five times in a row, that task is trying to
  tell you something. Either it's not actually a priority, it's too vague,
  or it needs to be broken into smaller pieces. The queue doesn't lie.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE IT -- A TYPICAL DAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEFORE YOU START:
1. Launch the app. The timer bar shows "Planning  20:00" and is stopped.
2. Look at the queue -- anything left over from yesterday will be waiting
   there. Drag or move items into today's blocks as needed.
3. Fill in today's tasks. Blocks 1-8 are your day. Plan it accordingly.
4. Hit ▶ Start when you're ready. (Finishing your coffee first is allowed.)

DURING THE DAY:
5. The timer counts down. Work on the tasks in the currently highlighted block.
6. Check off tasks as you complete them.
7. When a block finishes, the timer automatically starts the break countdown.
   You don't need to do anything.
8. When the break finishes, the next work block starts automatically.
9. Use ⏸ Pause if you need to step away and don't want the time to run out.
10. Use ⭭ Skip if you want to move to the next phase early.

END OF DAY:
11. After Block 8 the timer stops and announces the day is done.
    Or hit ■ End Day at any point to stop early.
12. Click "Start New Day" to close out the day:
    - All CHECKED tasks are logged to your completion history
    - All UNCHECKED tasks move to the Task Queue
    - All 8 blocks clear out for tomorrow
    - The timer resets to Planning
    - A summary shows how many tasks you completed
13. Fill in tomorrow's blocks and repeat.

  That's it. Seriously. The whole thing is just that.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUTTONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start New Day   Closes out today -- logs completed tasks, queues incomplete
                ones, resets timer. Asks for confirmation first.

Save            Manually saves everything to disk right now. (The app also
                auto-saves every 30 seconds and on every change, so you
                probably won't need this.)

Exit            Closes the app. Prompts to save if there are unsaved changes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO-SAVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app saves automatically:
  - Every 30 seconds in the background
  - Immediately whenever you add, edit, check, or delete a task

The "Ready" / "Saved" indicator in the bottom-right corner shows the current
save status. You should never lose work. If the app crashes or your computer
restarts mid-day, the timer will resume from where it left off when you
reopen the app.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOME vs. WORK DATASETS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app maintains two completely separate sets of task data:

  Home  -- your default dataset. Saved in the "data" folder.
  Work  -- a separate dataset for work context. Saved in "data-work" folder.

Switch between them using the Home / Work radio buttons in the timer bar.
Switching is instant -- each context has its own task blocks, queue, and
timer state. The timers run independently.

Work mode is always local-only (no cloud sync, even if cloud sync is
configured for Home).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANNOUNCEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app announces phase changes out loud. There are two modes:

LOCAL CHIME (works out of the box)
  Plays a chime sound through your computer's speakers at:
  - Start of each phase
  - 5 minutes remaining warning
  - 2 minutes remaining warning
  - End of each phase

  This works even if the app is minimized. If you're in another room and you
  hear the chime, that's your cue. The break is over. Get back to it.

VOICE MONKEY (requires external setup, not covered in this manual)
  Sends the announcements to Alexa devices via the Voice Monkey service.
  Requires an account at voicemonkey.io and API credentials.
  This is free but requires some tech know-how to set up.
  If not configured, the app falls back to local chime and works fine.

To switch modes: use the radio buttons in the top-left of the timer bar.
Your choice is saved automatically.

  NOTE: If your Alexa starts announcing "someone is at the everything" --
  that's a known Voice Monkey config issue and not the dogs' fault.
  Check the README for the workaround while it gets sorted out.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR DATA FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All data is stored locally in the app folder. No account required.

  data\tasks.json               Your current task blocks and queue (Home)
  data\config.json              App settings (Home)
  data\daily_stats.json         Daily completion statistics
  data\completed_log.json       Log of every completed task
  data\incomplete_history.json  Log of tasks that went to the queue
  data\timer_state.json         Saves timer position so it survives restarts

  data-work\                    Same set of files, but for the Work dataset

The timer state is saved every second while running. If the app closes
unexpectedly, the timer will resume from where it left off on relaunch.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Plan during Planning -- the 20-minute Planning phase is there for a reason.
  Use it to fill in your blocks before the work day starts. Front-load the
  thinking so you're not making decisions mid-block.

* Don't overfill blocks -- 45 minutes goes fast. 2-4 tasks per block is
  realistic. Be honest with yourself. Future-you will appreciate it.

* Use the queue honestly -- if something keeps living in the queue, that's
  data. Not failure. Data.

* The window is resizable -- drag it wider to see 3 or 4 block columns, or
  narrower for a single-column view.

* The timer keeps running if you minimize -- you don't need to babysit it.
  Local chime announcements will still play through your speakers.

* Getting something done is better than getting nothing done -- this sounds
  obvious until it's 3pm and you're considering scrapping the whole day because
  it didn't go as planned. It went. That counts.

WHY NO CUSTOMIZABLE TIMERS? (FAQ)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Can I change the block lengths?
A: No.

Q: Can I change the break lengths?
A: No.

Q: Can I add more blocks?
A: No.

Q: Why not?

A: Because the first thing an ADHD brain does with a customizable system is
   spend 40 minutes customizing it instead of working. Then the settings feel
   personal, which makes it worse when the system "fails." The fixed schedule
   removes that trap entirely.

   The session lengths were chosen to be generous enough to feel fair but short
   enough to feel doable. If 45 minutes of work followed by 15 minutes of rest
   sounds luxurious, good -- you'll actually do it. If it sounds too easy, good
   -- you'll actually do it.

   Flexibility is a feature that benefits people who don't need this kind of
   app. For the people who do need it, flexibility is where good intentions go
   to die.

   The rigidity is the accommodation.
